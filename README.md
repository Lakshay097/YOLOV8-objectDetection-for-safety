# YOLOv8 Object Detection for Safety

This project applies **YOLOv8** to detect safety equipment (like helmets, jackets, etc.) in images/videos.  
It helps ensure workplace safety by identifying whether workers are following safety protocols.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Trained YOLOv8 model on safety dataset  
- Real-time object detection with bounding boxes  
- Evaluation metrics: confusion matrix, PR curves, precision, recall  
- Pre-trained weights included (`best.pt`, `last.pt`)
